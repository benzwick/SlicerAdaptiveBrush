# Screenshots

This folder contains auto-generated screenshots for documentation and the 3D Slicer Extension Index.

## Auto-Generation

Screenshots are automatically generated by CI when changes are pushed to `main` that affect:
- `SegmentEditorAdaptiveBrush/**` (effect code)
- `scripts/capture_screenshots.py` (capture script)
- `.github/workflows/screenshots.yml` (workflow)

The workflow runs Slicer in a headless Linux environment, captures screenshots, and commits them back to the repository.

## Screenshots

| File | Description | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `main-ui.png` | Full Slicer window with Adaptive Brush | Extension Index, README hero image |
| `algorithm-panel.png` | Options panel with algorithm selection | Documentation |
| `segmentation-result.png` | Tumor segmented with Adaptive Brush | Before/after demonstration |

## Manual Regeneration

To regenerate screenshots locally:

```bash
# Requires Slicer with extension installed
Slicer --python-script scripts/capture_screenshots.py --exit

# Or interactively (to adjust before saving)
Slicer --python-script scripts/capture_screenshots.py
```

### Requirements

- 3D Slicer 5.8+ (5.10+ recommended)
- SlicerAdaptiveBrush extension installed
- Internet connection (to download MRBrainTumor1 sample data)

## Workflow Trigger
