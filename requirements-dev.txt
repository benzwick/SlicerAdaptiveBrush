# Dependencies for installing into 3D Slicer's Python environment
# Usage (in Slicer Python console):
#   pip_install('package-name')
#
# For local development OUTSIDE Slicer, use uv instead:
#   uv sync --dev
#
# Note: Core dependencies (numpy, SimpleITK, vtk, scipy) are bundled with Slicer

# Testing (install into Slicer for running tests)
pytest>=7.0.0

# Optional: For GMM-based intensity analysis
# Slicer 5.x typically bundles sklearn, check first:
#   import sklearn  # if ImportError, then install:
# scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# Optional: GPU acceleration
# pyopencl  # For OpenCL GPU backend
# cupy      # For CUDA GPU backend (requires CUDA toolkit)
